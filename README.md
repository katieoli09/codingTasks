# Find-Repeating-Elements
### Task to find repeating elements in an array of size n

Steps:
* Define a function to identify any repeats in numbers based on those already present.
* Function checks if an element is present in the 'present' set.
* If it is, then it's classed as a duplicate and is added to the 'repeats' set.
* If not, the element is added to the 'present' set.
* Function then returns a list of duplicate elements found in the array.

 # XOR
### Task to find elements in an array using XOR

Steps:
* Define a function to pick out numbers in the array we want to use with a for loop.
* In the case of this code, we want the numbers that are divisible by 10, therefore we set the divisor variable to 10.
* We can then calculate the XOR value for the select numbers in the array and print the result.
